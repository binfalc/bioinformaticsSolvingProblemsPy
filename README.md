Solving bioinformatics problems with Python from Rosalind platform


<h2>1. Counting DNA Nucleotides</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>

A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word; the length of a string is     the number of symbols that it contains.

An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."

<ul>
  <li>Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.</li>
  <li>Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.</li>
</ul>


<h2>2. Transcribing DNA into RNA</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>

An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'U'.

Given a DNA string t corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string u is formed by replacing all occurrences of 'T' in t with 'U' in u.

<ul>
  <li>Given: A DNA string t having length at most 1000 nt.</li>
  <li>Return: The transcribed RNA string of t.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Complementing a Strand of DNA</h3>

<h3>Problem</h3>

In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.

The reverse complement of a DNA string s is the string sc formed by reversing the symbols of s, then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").

<ul>
<li>Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.</li>

<li>Return: The reverse complement sc of s.</li>
</ul>
